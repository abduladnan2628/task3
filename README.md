# SQL Data Extraction Practice

This project demonstrates basic SQL queries for extracting data using common clauses and operators like `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, and `ORDER BY`.

## 🗂️ Table Used

A simple `Students` table is used for all examples.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    stu_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    fee INT,
    join_date DATE
);
````

## 📥 Sample Data

```sql
INSERT INTO Students (stu_id, name, department, fee, join_date) VALUES
(1, 'Adnan', 'DS', 50000, '2022-10-15'),
(2, 'Sony', 'CSE', 60000, '2022-10-10'),
(3, 'Abdul', 'DS', 45000, '2023-08-20'),
(4, 'James', 'ML', 52000, '2023-09-01'),
(5, 'Sameer', 'CSE', 57000, '2022-09-12');
```

## 🧪 SQL Query Examples

### 🔹 Select All Columns

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students;
```

### 🔹 Select Specific Columns

```sql
SELECT name, fee FROM Students;
```

### 🔹 Filter with WHERE

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE department = 'CSE';
```

### 🔹 Combine Conditions with AND

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE department = 'DS' AND fee > 47000;
```

### 🔹 Use OR for Alternatives

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE department = 'ML' OR fee > 70000;
```

### 🔹 Pattern Matching with LIKE

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
```

### 🔹 Filter by Range with BETWEEN

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE fee BETWEEN 52000 AND 60000;
```

### 🔹 Sort Results with ORDER BY

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students ORDER BY fee ASC;
```
